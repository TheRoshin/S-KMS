                <div class="panel">
                    <p>You may think that big businesses with more endpoints are more vulnerable than small businesses. Or, businesses with attractive data, 
                        like financial services companies or those in the healthcare industry, would be easy targets. 
                        That’s not always the case—of course, they hold an incredible amount of data, 
                        but it’s like trying to rob the Federal Reserve gold vault versus robbing a regular Joe on the street. Bigger businesses or 
                        those that handle sensitive data typically have the technology, regulations, and processes to protect themselves from cyberattacks.
                        On the other hand, small and medium-sized businesses without dedicated IT expertise, cybersecurity technology, processes, or 
                        education are easy targets for hackers.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Are organizations doing enough to combat cyberthreats?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Cybersecurity requires consistent education, company-wide processes, and executive-level commitment. Generally, 
                        there needs to be more awareness surrounding how quickly hackers can initiate a cyberattack, how quickly cyberattacks evolve, 
                        and how businesses need multiple layers of cybersecurity to protect themselves—especially in modern workplace environments 
                        where employees are working remotely and sharing a ton of important data via digital communication channels.</p>
